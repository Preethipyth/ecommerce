# E-Commerce Data Analysis Application

This application provides a command-line interface (CLI) for analyzing e-commerce data stored in a MySQL database. It allows users to run SQL queries by name, specify a time window, and filter data based on a category.

## Workflow

1. **Setup MySQL Instance**: Deploy a MySQL instance and load it with e-commerce data.
2. **Build Command-line Interface (CLI)**: Create a Python CLI script (`cli.py`) to run SQL queries by name.
3. **Post-process Output**: Calculate derived features from query results (e.g., total orders, popular item).
4. **Build Python Package**: Organize code into a Python package (`ecommerce_analyzer`) with modules for CLI, MySQL utilities, and post-processing logic.
5. **Run Against MySQL Database**: Ensure the package can connect to and execute queries against the MySQL database.
6. **Code Management**: Use Git for version control and follow coding standards and best practices.
7. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Implement logging, error handling, and monitoring mechanisms.
8. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: Define a structured SDLC process including code versioning, feature tracking, deployment, and monitoring.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    py setup.py install
    ```

3. Setup MySQL instance and populate it with e-commerce data.

## Usage

1. Run the CLI script to execute SQL queries:

    ```bash
    ecommerce_analyzer demand daily 2020-08-01 2020-08-05 T-Shirts
    ```

    Replace `demand` with the desired query name, `daily` with the window type, and provide start and end dates and category accordingly.

2. The script will connect to the MySQL database, execute the query, post-process the output, and display the results along with derived features.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
5. Create a new pull request.
