# E-Commerce Data Analysis Application

This application provides a command-line interface (CLI) for analyzing e-commerce data stored in a MySQL database. It allows users to run SQL queries by name, specify a time window, and filter data based on a category.

## Workflow

1. **Setup MySQL Instance**: Deploy a MySQL instance and load it with e-commerce data.
2. **Build Command-line Interface (CLI)**: Create a Python CLI script (`cli.py`) to run SQL queries by name.
3. **Post-process Output**: Calculate derived features from query results (e.g., total orders, popular item).
4. **Build Python Package**: Organize code into a Python package (`ecommerce_analyzer`) with modules for CLI, MySQL utilities, and post-processing logic.
5. **Run Against MySQL Database**: Ensure the package can connect to and execute queries against the MySQL database.
6. **Code Management**: Use Git for version control and follow coding standards and best practices.
7. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Implement logging, error handling, and monitoring mechanisms.
8. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: Define a structured SDLC process including code versioning, feature tracking, deployment, and monitoring.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-data-analysis.git
    ```
2. Install Directory:
   ```bash
   ecommerce_analyzer
    ---- move all files in this directory except setup.py
   ''''
3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    py setup.py install
    ```

4. Setup MySQL instance and populate it with e-commerce data.

## Usage

1. Run the CLI script to execute SQL queries:

    ```bash
    ecommerce_analyzer demand daily 2020-08-01 2020-08-05 T-Shirts
    ```

    Replace `demand` with the desired query name, `daily` with the window type, and provide start and end dates and category accordingly.

2. The script will connect to the MySQL database, execute the query, post-process the output, and display the results along with derived features.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
5. Create a new pull request.

## SDLC WORKFLOW
1. Code Versioning and Standards:
Version Control System (VCS): Utilize Git as the VCS.
Branching Strategy: Implement GitFlow for managing branches (e.g., feature branches, release branches).
Code Standards: Enforce PEP 8 coding standards using linters (e.g., flake8) and code reviews.

2. Product Feature Tracking:
Issue Tracking: Utilize a project management tool (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) to track features, bugs, and enhancements.
User Stories and Epics: Break down features into user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
Backlog Management: Maintain a prioritized backlog of features and tasks.

4. Deployment:
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
Environment Management: Maintain separate environments (e.g., development, staging, production) for testing and deployment.
Automated Testing: Include automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.
Rollback Procedures: Establish procedures for rolling back deployments in case of failures.

5. Monitoring:
Logging: Implement logging to capture runtime information, errors, and warnings.
Metrics Collection: Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect and visualize application metrics.
Alerting: Configure alerting mechanisms to notify stakeholders of system issues or performance degradation.
Performance Testing: Conduct regular performance testing to identify and address bottlenecks.

6. Datasets:
Data Versioning: Version datasets using tools like DVC (Data Version Control) to track changes and ensure reproducibility.
Backup and Recovery: Implement regular backups of datasets to prevent data loss. Define procedures for data recovery in case of failures.
Data Governance: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) and establish data governance policies.

7. Upstream and Downstream Dependencies:
Dependency Management: Document and manage dependencies, including database connections and external libraries.
Versioning: Track versions of dependencies and manage updates carefully to avoid compatibility issues.
Communication: Maintain communication with upstream and downstream teams to coordinate changes and updates effectively.

SDLC Workflow:
Planning: Define project scope, requirements, and milestones. Break down features into user stories and epics.
Development: Implement features based on user stories. Conduct code reviews and ensure adherence to coding standards.
Testing: Perform testing (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) to ensure code quality and functionality.
Deployment: Deploy changes to testing environments (e.g., staging) using automated CI/CD pipelines. Validate changes through testing.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitor application performance and behavior in production. Address any issues promptly and perform regular maintenance tasks.
Feedback and Iteration: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders. Iterate on the product based on feedback and evolving requirements.
